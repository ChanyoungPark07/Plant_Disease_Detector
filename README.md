Plant Disease Detection

Plant disease has been one of the leading causes of crop failure, leading to horrible health conditions, unpredictable crop yield and economic recessions. 
The purpose of this project was to build a neural network model using PyTorch to accurately identify plant diseases using a comprehensive dataset comprising images of various plant species annotated with corresponding labels of healthy and unhealthy.
